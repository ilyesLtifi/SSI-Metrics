The purpose was to ease and automate the process of acquiring the 27001 Information Security standard within companies.

It started by:
  * Analysing the functional needs of this solution
  * Finishing use-case and class system designs
  * Researching the official theory behind the standard, which led to the 4-step cycle of the ISO 27001: the Plan Do Check Act
  * Researching and gathering of the tasks of each phase in the cycle
  * Automating the creation of a database with these tasks whenever an organization creates its new account


The clients are divided into 2 groups:
  * Collaborator; the regular employees of the company that are chosen to participate in the journey for acquiring the certification
  * Information Security Agent; responsable of creating the account for the company, managing the tasks, and overviewing the collaborators

The Agent starts by creating the account, creating a workspace for the company then inviting the rest of the team.
From there they begin following the path and finishing the tasks till the end.

There are several analytics/reportings tools for the company's executives to overview the whole operation and see some statistics about the
team's performances.

Here are some screenshots of the final product: (the whole work was originally done in French)
