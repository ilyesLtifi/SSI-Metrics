The purpose was to ease and automate the process of acquiring the 27001 Information Security standard within companies.

It started by:
  * Analysing the functional needs of this solution
  * Finishing use-case and class system designs
  * Researching the official theory behind the standard, which led to the 4-step cycle of the ISO 27001: the Plan Do Check Act
  * Researching and gathering of the tasks of each phase in the cycle
  * Automating the creation of a database with these tasks whenever an organization creates its new account


The clients are divided into 2 groups:
  * Collaborator; the regular employees of the company that are chosen to participate in the journey for acquiring the certification
  * Information Security Agent; responsable of creating the account for the company, managing the tasks, and overviewing the collaborators

The Agent starts by creating the account then inviting the rest of the team.
From there they begin following the path and finishing the tasks till the end.

There are several analytics/reportings tools for the company's executives to overview the whole operation and see some statistics about the
team's performances.

Here are some screenshots of the final product: (the whole work was originally done in French)
